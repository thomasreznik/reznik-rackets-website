# reznik-rackets-website


For my senior capstone, I have designed a mock tennis shop website called Reznik’s Rackets. 
Created with the customer in mind, website visitors will be able to explore the shop’s products and varying information. 
The project was inspired by small business owners, specifically small mom and pop shops that have a passion for tennis. 
I worked at a tennis shop last summer and saw a need for a direct resource for customers to learn more about the products and offerings before entering the shop, 
and this website is designed to do just that.

The site can be reached with this url: http://thomasreznik.com/Capstone/Login.html

Enjoy!
